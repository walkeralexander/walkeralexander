<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Walker Alexander ðŸŒŽ</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a Software Engineer that builds systems for data processing, automated decision-making and machine learning in the Climate space. I'm currently a Senior AI/ML Engineer on Aclima's Data Science team, where I work on everything from IoT data ingestion to route planning for a fleet of mobile sensors to deploying APIs that support frontend applications with critical data. I previously worked at Lockheed Martin applying similar techniques to advanced manufacturing and biological signal processing.

When I'm away from my computer you can fine me taking photos, hiking with my dog Stanley or playing basketball!
